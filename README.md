                        #### UH Energy Sustainable Energy Development Program - Bronze Belt #####

I enrolled in this program to get more hands-on experience in the oil and gas industry on data analytics and data science concepts and applications with real-world examples and energy sector data. I also had the chance to work with Tableau and Kaggle Competitions!

I was able to design data mining models for classifying and clustering via various machine learning algorithms including kNN, decision trees, linear regression, k-means clustering, and many more techniques. I was also able to evaluate the models’ performance via various validation techniques including accuracy and cost-sensitive measures such as the ROC approach.

Being in the Bronze Belt helped me get a birds-eye view of the data analytics process and explore one of the four data analytics modules called exploratory data analysis, a necessary step to get the feel of the data and data preprocessing, and to clean and format the data before building machine learning models.

Supervised machine learning concepts were introduced, and we were able to build data-driven models via supervised machine learning algorithms and engaged in hands-on labs using the Orange data mining tool for designing and evaluating the models. 



*****  Please note that the Orange Workflow are ows files, and seems I cannot uploaded those here to be visually readable. 
       Instead, I will provide a screenshot of my workflow and some of my       
       work process to show the findings and testing that were involved in our labs as much as I can  ******
       
 ***** Also, you will notice I have some .xlsx and .csv files uploaded raw within some labs. 
       These files are meant to be uploaded within the "Files" widget within Orange in order to 
       explore the dataset given for the purpose of the lab, if you wish to try it yourself. 
       I will share my findings within each lab (PDF files) and how I set up my Orange workflow, or 
       pipeline as they call it, in a PNG file. *****




"Bronze" Belt Description:

Designed and presented by leaders from industry and accomplished faculty from the University of Houston, the program provides a structured series of micro-credentials or “badges” that cover the changing energy landscape and build the skills to succeed in it. The Bronze belt consists of three badges:

Badge 1 – Energy Transition: Provides a background of the energy industry – the suppliers, the customers, the global supply-demand challenges, and the environmental issues in different sectors of the industry. It adresses the Energy Trilemma, requiring affordable, accessible and reliable, and environmentally responsible energy solutions that simultaneously satisfy all elements of this trilemma are the foundation and essence of the Sustainable Energy Development Program. Industry case studies analyzing key aspects of sustainability will be reviewed - deciding on what to measure and how to communicate progress – a key component to tracking one’s progress in addressing the Trilemma.
 
Badge 2 – Energy Value Chain: Examines the pathways for a sustainable transition away from fossil fuels. Energy transitions are not new: the world has undergone several big shifts in its dominant energy sources. We first look at this history and the lessons it offers. Then, we talk about coal: the fuel which industrialized and continues to industrialize the world, but at a great societal and environmental cost. The focus then shifts to oil and natural gas, which are central to our current energy supply but face numerous issues of their own. Some alternatives to them (nuclear and hydroelectric energy) are up and running, but not on a large enough scale to displace them. Others (wind, solar, and biomass) are growing rapidly from a low base. The class concludes with a critical look at our energy consumption patterns.
 
Badge 3 – Evaluating Sustainable Energy Options: Introduces key dimensions for evaluating sustainable energy options, factors to consider, information required, and a framework to use. It also provides instruction on some tools to use in the evaluation process, including breakout sessions to reinforce concepts and for learners to practice the techniques that have been taught.
