          #### UH Energy Sustainable Energy Development Program - Bronze Belt #####

I enrolled into this program to get more on the hands-on experience in the oil and gas industry on data analytics concepts and applications with real world examples.

Designed and presented by leaders from industry and accomplished faculty from the University of Houston, the program provides a structured series of micro-credentials or “badges” that cover the changing energy landscape and build the skills to succeed in it.

Participants in the Bronze Belt will get a bird-eye view of the data analytics process and explore one of the four data analytics modules called exploratory data analysis, a necessary step to get the feel of the data and data preprocessing, and to clean and format the data before building machine learning models. 

Supervised machine learning concepts will be introduced, and participants will be able to build data-driven models via supervised machine learning algorithms. Two representative machine learning algorithms - one for classification and the other for regression - will be covered. Learning will be reinforced with through a hands-on labs using Orange software.


Belt Descriptions:

Badge 1 – Energy Transition: Provides a background of the energy industry – the suppliers, the customers, the global supply demand challenges, and the environmental issues in different sectors of the industry; understanding which is important in making decision on addressing the Trilemma. Industry case studies analyzing key aspects of sustainability will be reviewed - deciding on what to measure and how to communicate progress – a key component to track one’s progress in addressing the Trilemma.
 
Badge 2 – Energy Value Chain: Examines the pathways for a sustainable transition away from fossil fuels. Energy transitions are not new: the world has undergone several big shifts in its dominant energy sources. We first look at this history and the lessons it offers. Then, we talk about coal: the fuel which industrialized and continues to industrialize the world, but at a great societal and environmental cost. The focus then shifts to oil and natural gas, which are central to our current energy supply, but face numerous issues of their own. Some alternatives to them—nuclear and hydroelectric energy—are up and running, but not on a large enough scale to displace them. Others—wind, solar, and biomass—are growing rapidly from a low base. The class concludes with a critical look at our energy consumption patterns.
 
Badge 3 – Evaluating Sustainable Energy Options: Introduces key dimensions for evaluating sustainable energy options – factors to consider, information required, and a framework to use. It also provides instruction in some tools to use in the evaluation process; and it includes breakout sessions to reinforce concepts and for learners to practice the techniques that have taught.
